/*
 * Sample arduino sketch using contiki features.
 * We turn the LED off 
 * We allow read the moisture sensor
 * Unfortunately sleeping for long times in loop() isn't currently
 * possible, something turns off the CPU (including PWM outputs) if a
 * Proto-Thread is taking too long. We need to find out how to sleep in
 * a Contiki-compatible way.
 * Note that for a normal arduino sketch you won't have to include any
 * of the contiki-specific files here, the sketch should just work.
