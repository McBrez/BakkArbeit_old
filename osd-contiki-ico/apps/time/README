Timezones
=========

The new version supports time zones and daylight saving time (DST).
Currently we support only a single timezone. We use the UNIX timezone
format which is usually specified in an environment variable TZ.

Note that for timezone information you can have different
representation, either relative to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) or
to International Atomic Time (TAI), the latter contains leap seconds.
Since most systems today use UTC *and* the clock of a microcontroller
is typically not accurate enough to care about leap seconds, we're using
timezone files relative to UTC.

Wikipedia has a very good treatment of the public timezone database in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database

The format of timezone strings is described in the Linux manual page
tzset(3). The timezone specification for Europe/Vienna is
CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3
